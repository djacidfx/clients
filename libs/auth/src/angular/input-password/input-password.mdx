# InputPassword Component

The `InputPasswordComponent` allows a user to enter master password related credentials. On form
submission, the component creates cryptographic properties (`newMasterKey`,
`newServerMasterKeyHash`, etc.) and emits those properties to the parent (along with the other
values defined in `PasswordInputResult`).

The component is intended for re-use in different scenarios throughout the application. Therefore it
is mostly presentational and simply emits values rather than acting on them itself. It is the job of
the parent component to act on those values as needed.

## `@Input()`'s

**Required**

- `flow` - the parent component must provide an `InputPasswordFlow`, which is used to determine
  which form input elements will be displayed in the UI and which cryptographic keys will be created
  and emitted.
- `email` - the parent component must provide an email so that the `InputPasswordComponent` can
  create a master key.

**Optional**

- `loading` - a boolean used to indicate that the parent component is performing some
  long-running/async operation and that the form should be disabled until the operation is complete.
  The primary button will also show a spinner if `loading` is true.
- `masterPasswordPolicyOptions` - used to display and enforce master password policy requirements.
- `inlineButtons` - takes a boolean that determines if the button(s) should be displayed inline (as
  opposed to full-width)
- `primaryButtonText` - takes a `Translation` object that can be used as button text
- `secondaryButtonText` - takes a `Translation` object that can be used as button text

<br />

## `@Output()`'s

- `onPasswordFormSubmit` - on form submit, emits a `PasswordInputResult` object
- `onSecondaryButtonClick` - on click, emits a notice that the secondary button has been clicked.
  The parent component can listen for this event and take some custom action as needed (go back,
  cancel, logout, etc.)

<br />

## The `InputPasswordFlow`

The `InputPasswordFlow` is a crucial and required `@Input` that influences both the HTML and the
credential generation logic of the component.

<br />

### HTML - Form Fields

The `InputPasswordFlow` determines which form fields get displayed in the UI.

**`InputPasswordFlow.AccountRegistration`** and **`InputPasswordFlow.SetInitialPasswordAuthedUser`**

- Input: New password
- Input: Confirm new password
- Input: Hint
- Checkbox: Check for breaches

**`InputPasswordFlow.ChangePassword`**

Includes everything above, plus:

- Input: Current password (as the first element in the UI)

**`InputPasswordFlow.ChangePasswordWithOptionalUserKeyRotation`**

Includes everything above, plus:

- Checkbox: Rotate account encryption key (as the last element in the UI)

<br />

### TypeScript - Credential Generation

- The `AccountRegistration` and `SetInitialPasswordAuthedUser` flows involve a user setting their
  password for the first time. Therefore on submit the component will only generate new credentials
  (`newMasterKey`) and not current credentials (`currentMasterKey`).
- The `ChangePassword` and `ChangePasswordWithOptionalUserKeyRotation` flows both require the user
  to enter a current password along with a new password. Therefore on submit the component will
  generate current credentials (`currentMasterKey`) along with new credentials (`newMasterKey`).

<br />

### Difference between `AccountRegistration` and `SetInitialPasswordAuthedUser`

These two flows are similar in that they display the same form fields and only generate new
credentials, but we need to keep them separate for the following reasons:

- `AccountRegistration` involves scenarios where we have no existing user, and **thus NO active
  account `userId`**:

  - Standard Account Registration
  - Email Invite Account Registration
  - Trial Initiation Account Registration

<br />

- `SetInitialPasswordAuthedUser` involves scenarios where we do have an existing and authed user,
  and **thus an active account `userId`**:
  - A "just-in-time" (JIT) provisioned user joins a master password (MP) encryption org and must set
    their initial password
  - A "just-in-time" (JIT) provisioned user joins a trusted device encryption (TDE) org with a
    starting role that requires them to have/set their initial password
    - A note on JIT provisioned user flows:
      - Even though a JIT provisioned user is a brand-new user who was “just” created, we consider
        them to be an “existing authed user” _from the perspective of the set-password flow_. This
        is because at the time they set their initial password, their account already exists in the
        database (before setting their password) and they have already authenticated via SSO.
      - The same is not true in the account registration flows above&mdash;that is, during account
        registration when a user reaches the `/finish-signup` or `/trial-initiation` page to set
        their initial password, their account does not yet exist in the database, and will only be
        created once they set an initial password.
  - An existing user in a TDE org logs in after the org admin upgraded the user to a role that now
    requires them to have/set their initial password
  - An existing user logs in after their org admin offboarded the org from TDE, and the user must
    now have/set their initial password

The presence or absence of an active account `userId` is important because it determines how we get
the correct `kdfConfig` prior to key generation:

- If there is no `userId` passed down from the parent, we default to `DEFAULT_KDF_CONFIG`
- If there is a `userId` passed down from the parent, we get the `kdfConfig` from state using the
  `userId`

That said, we cannot mark the `userId` as a required via `@Input({ required: true })` because
`AccountRegistration` flows will not have a `userId`. But we still want to require a `userId` in a
`SetInitialPasswordAuthedUser` flow. Therefore the `InputPasswordComponent` has init logic that
ensures the following:

- If the passed down flow is `AccountRegistration`, require that the parent **MUST NOT** have passed
  down a `userId`
- If the passed down flow is `SetInitialPasswordAuthedUser` require that the parent must also have
  passed down a `userId`

If either of these checks is not met, the component throws to alert the dev of a mistake.

<br />

## Validation

Form validators ensure that:

- The current password and new password are NOT the same
- The new password and confirmed new password are the same
- The new password and password hint are NOT the same

Additional submit logic validation ensures that:

- The new password adheres to any enforced master password policy options (that were passed down
  from the parent)

<br />

## Submit Logic

When the form is submitted, the `InputPasswordComponent` does the following in order:

1. Verifies inputs:
   - Checks that the current password is correct (if it was required in the flow)
   - Checks if the new password is found in a breach and warns the user if so (if the user selected
     the checkbox)
   - Checks that the new password meets any master password policy requirements enforced by an org
2. Uses the form inputs to create cryptographic properties (`newMasterKey`,
   `newServerMasterKeyHash`, etc.)
3. Emits those cryptographic properties up to the parent (along with other values defined in
   `PasswordInputResult`) to be used by the parent as needed.

```typescript
export interface PasswordInputResult {
  // Properties starting with "current..." are included if the flow is ChangePassword or ChangePasswordWithOptionalUserKeyRotation
  currentPassword?: string;
  currentMasterKey?: MasterKey;
  currentServerMasterKeyHash?: string;
  currentLocalMasterKeyHash?: string;

  newPassword: string;
  newPasswordHint: string;
  newMasterKey: MasterKey;
  newServerMasterKeyHash: string;
  newLocalMasterKeyHash: string;

  kdfConfig: KdfConfig;
  rotateUserKey?: boolean; // included if the flow is ChangePasswordWithOptionalUserKeyRotation
}
```
